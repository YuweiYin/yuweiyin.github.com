<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>Hi! I am Yuwei (/ˈjuːweɪ/), an NLPhile, namely a technophile of natural language processing. My research interest lies in natural language understanding &amp; generation, multilingual NLP, and interpretable NLP. With the help of advanced computing processors and powerful statistical algorithms, dealing with human language is becoming more and more promising. Yet human language is not just about counting, repeating, and probability. Thus in-depth NLP research had better take into account the linguistic factors and refer to the language acquisition process of human beings. This intriguing research will help us better understand ourselves. The finding and explanation of human beings, nature, and the universe deeply motivate me to go on a fascinating lifelong research Odyssey.</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out to me, especially about NLP research.</p>

<h2 id="academic--research-background">Academic &amp; Research Background</h2>

<h3 id="undergraduate-2014---2018">Undergraduate (2014 - 2018)</h3>

<p>I received my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology from <a href="https://english.bistu.edu.cn/">Beijing Information Science &amp; Technology University</a>, where I comprehensively studied various CS courses and developed a solid foundation in the CS field. In my sophomore year, I started my first research on the National Undergraduate Innovation Project. One year later, we developed a smart band system (Software &amp; Hardware) to measure the heart rate and sports situation and published a Chinese journal paper. Then in my senior year, I interned at <a href="http://english.is.cas.cn/">Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>, where I finished my graduation project by developing a privacy-protected bicycle-sharing system (Android &amp; Web applications) based on single sign-on (SSO) and OAuth 2.0 &amp; OpenID Connect.</p>

<h3 id="postgraduate-2018---2021">Postgraduate (2018 - 2021)</h3>

<p>After graduation, I was recommended to the M.S. program at the State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment, School of Computer Science and Engineering, <a href="https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/">Beihang University</a>. In the first year, we developed the data mining and website system for a funded program. Apart from the lab project and advanced CS courses, I studied machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing by myself. Then I decided to dive into NLP research and changed my program to Ph.D. in 2019.</p>

<p>In my first doctoral year, I still had to take general CS instead of NLP-specific courses. Meanwhile, I worked as a teaching assistant in Discrete Mathematics and took on the operation and maintenance of a lab system. Back then, I was intrigued by neural machine translation (NMT) research. Unfortunately, my experiments were hard to conduct smoothly, mainly because the computing resource was rather scarce in the lab. To add insult to injury, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19">COVID-19</a> forced everyone to stay at home until Fall 2020.</p>

<p>After returning to Beijing, I decided to take an internship in the research group of a technology company with adequate computing resources. Then, I joined the Natural Language Computing (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-computing/">NLC</a>) group of Microsoft Research Asia (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/">MSRA</a>) as a full-time research intern. Since then, I immersed myself in a positive academic atmosphere and focused on NMT research, solving the low- or zero-resource multilingual translation problems. It was extremely enjoyable to design cutting-edge NLP algorithms and to have inspiring and scintillating discussions with so many excellent researchers.</p>

<h3 id="watershed-september-2021">Watershed (September 2021)</h3>

<!-- However, to my mind, relying on the internship to finish the Ph.D. program is not a long-term solution. Let alone the policy that interns have to check out after 1.5 years at most in Microsoft. To pursue careers in academia, I was determined to reboot my postgraduate journey and get a doctorate degree elsewhere. -->
<p>However, to my mind, relying on the internship to finish the Ph.D. program was not desirable. Let alone the policy that interns had to check out after 1.5 years at most in Microsoft. To pursue careers in academia, I was determined to reboot my postgraduate journey and get a doctorate degree elsewhere. In fact, I planned to apply to programs in the US. Since Beihang University is the top target of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_10043">Presidential Proclamation 10043</a>, I chose to forgo the Master’s degree there in order to have a better chance of getting the VISA and admission. Therefore, I left Beijing in September 2021, gave myself one year gap, and applied for oversea Ph.D. programs at the end of 2022.</p>

<h2 id="gap-year-2022">Gap Year (2022)</h2>

<p>To be continued…</p>

<h2 id="about-my-name">About My Name</h2>

<!-- ## Etymology of My Name -->

<p>My name is 阴昱为 Yin-Yuwei (/ˈjɪnˌjuːweɪ/).</p>

<p>My family name 阴 Yin dates from the 7th generation descendant of a Chinese philosopher and politician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guan_Zhong">Guan Zhong</a> (c. 720–645 B.C.).
In Ancient Chinese philosophy, 阴阳 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang">yin and yang</a> (/ˈjɪn/ and /ˈjɑːŋ, ˈjæŋ/; “dark-light”, “negative-positive”) is a Chinese philosophical concept that describes how obviously opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another.</p>

<p>昱 as a noun, it means tomorrow. Because the upper part is 日 (the sun) and the lower part is 立 (to stand). Together, it means the sun rises, indicating a new day. Thus it also denotes light and sunshine.
As a verb, 昱 means to shine, to light, and to illuminate.
As an adjective, 昱 means shiny, bright, and glorious.</p>

<p>为 has many meanings and various parts of speech, including the verb, noun, preposition, conjunction, and auxiliary word. Its basic meaning is to do, to act, and to make.</p>

<p>The right part of 阴 is 月, meaning the moon. Therefore, 阴昱 contains yin and yang, the moon and the sun.
昱为 can be explained as standing under the sun and making achievements.</p>

<p>Joey has a similar pronunciation to 久湮, which is the name I give myself. 久 means long (time), permanent, and eternal. 湮 means annihilation or to annihilate. Together, it stands for a paradoxical harmony, just like yin and yang.</p>
