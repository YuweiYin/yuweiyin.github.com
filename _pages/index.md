Hi, I am Yuwei Yin, I enjoy a life of adventure, both mentally and physically. This website includes my traveling, thinking, reading, and writing. I hope you can find something inspiring here ([BLOG](./blog/)). The discovery and explanation of human beings, intelligence, and the universe drive me to embark on a fascinating lifelong research journey. ( [Academic Homepage](https://www.yuweiyin.com/) )
