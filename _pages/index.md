Hi, I am Yuwei Yin, I enjoy a life of adventure, both mentally and physically. This website includes my traveling, thinking, reading, and writing. I hope you can find something inspiring here.

What do we really mean by "understanding"? How exactly do we humans make sentences in our brains? What is the purpose of language? To what extent does language related to human intelligence? How exactly do children acquire their first language? Can we reimplement first language acquisition in computer programs? What does multilingualism mean to us? How can we break the language barrier to promote peace in the world? Are we humans just slaves of our own sensors, i.e., visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and tactile sensations? Do we humans have free will? If so, can we program free will in computers to enable spontaneity and initiative in AI systems? Otherwise, what is the difference between humans and robots, i.e., are we another kind of robot designed by some superior beings? How long will our civilizations last? What are the quantum world, outer space, and the inside of a black hole like? Is there an absolute truth or a universal law that governs everything? The discovery and explanation of human beings, nature, and the universe drive me to embark on a fascinating lifelong research journey. ( [Academic Homepage](https://www.yuweiyin.com/) )
