Hi, I am Yuwei Yin, a natural language processing (NLP) researcher in the HKU NLP Group at the Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong. I enjoy a life of adventure, both mentally and physically. This website includes my traveling, thinking, reading, and writing. I hope you can find something inspiring here.

What do we really mean by "understanding"? How exactly do we humans make sentences in our brains? What is the purpose of language? What does multilingualism mean to us? How can we break the language barrier to promote peace in the world? Will our civilizations last any longer? What are the quantum world, outer space, and the inside of a black hole like? Is there an absolute truth or a universal law that governs everything? Are we human beings the slave of our own sensors, i.e., visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and tactile sensations? The discovery and explanation of human beings, nature, and the universe drive me to embark on a fascinating lifelong research journey. ([Academic Homepage](https://www.yuweiyin.com/))
