## About Me (he/him/his)

Hi! I am Yuwei (/ˈjuːweɪ/), an NLPhile -- technophile of natural language processing (NLP).

<!-- Currently, I am applying to the PhD program for Fall 2023 admission. -->
<!-- I will join the [HKU NLP](https://nlp.cs.hku.hk/) group as a research assistant from Fall 2022 to Fall 2023. -->

My research interest lies in natural language understanding & generation, multilingual NLP, and interpretable NLP. Accordingly, my research goals are mainly three folds: 1. to improve the understanding and generating ability of general NLP models; 2. to tap the potential of multilingual NLP in a broader scenario; 3. to fathom the essence of NLP models and make them more interpretable, understandable, and controllable.

<!-- With the help of advanced computing processors and powerful statistical algorithms, automatically dealing with human language is becoming more and more promising. Human language, however, is more than just counting, repetition, and probability. Hence, in-depth NLP research must thoroughly analyze the linguistic factors and refer to the language acquisition process of human beings. This intriguing research will help us better understand ourselves. -->

What do we really mean by understanding? How exactly do we human make sentences? How can computers do what we can do in terms of language? What does multilinguality mean to us? How can we break the language barrier to promote peace in the world? The discovery and explanation of human beings, nature, and the universe drive me to embark on a fascinating lifelong research Odyssey.

## About My Name

My name is 阴昱为 Yin-Yuwei (/ˈjɪnˌjuːweɪ/).

My family name 阴 Yin dates from the 7th generation descendant of a Chinese philosopher and politician [Guan Zhong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guan_Zhong) (c. 720–645 B.C.).
In Ancient Chinese philosophy, 阴阳 [yin and yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang) (/ˈjɪn/ and /ˈjɑːŋ, ˈjæŋ/; "dark-light", "negative-positive") is a Chinese philosophical concept that describes how obviously opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another.

昱 as a noun, it means tomorrow. Because the upper part is 日 (the sun) and the lower part is 立 (to stand). Together, it means the sun rises, indicating a new day. Thus it also denotes light and sunshine.
As a verb, 昱 means to shine, to light, and to illuminate.
As an adjective, 昱 means shiny, bright, and glorious.

为 has multiple meanings and different parts of speech, including the verb, noun, preposition, conjunction, and auxiliary word. In general, its basic meaning is to do, to act, and to make.

The right part of 阴 is 月, meaning the moon. Therefore, 阴昱 contains yin and yang, the moon and the sun.
昱为 can be explained as standing under the sun and making achievements.

Joey has a similar pronunciation to 久湮, which is the name I give myself. 久 means long (time), permanent, and eternal. 湮 means annihilation or to annihilate. Together, it stands for a paradoxical harmony, just like yin and yang.
