<h2 id="question-of-interest">List of Questions of My Interest</h2>

* **Intelligence and Language**:
  * What is intelligence? (Maybe it's an illusion/delusion that we think we have.)
  * To what extent does language related to human intelligence?
  * What do we really mean by knowing or understanding something?
  * How exactly do we humans think in our brains? (Can we think without languages?)
  * What is the purpose of language? (The existence of language seems unnatural.)
  * Is there a thing that only a specific language can talk about?
    * (Regardless of factors like region, culture, religion, country, etc.)
    * If so, find a true example. If not, is multilingualism necessary?
    * Why not speak the same language if we are talking the same thing?
    * How can we break language barriers (to promote peace and collaboration)?
  * Is language necessary? Why can't we communicate via the mind?
    * Maybe we can, but we don't know how; Maybe we could, but we lost the ability.
  * How exactly do children acquire (not learn) their first language?
  * Can we reimplement first language acquisition in computer programs?

* **Human beings (Ego/Self, Self-consciousness, and Free Will)**:
  * What are we? Where do we come from? Who/what created us in the first place?
  * Who am I? (The question implies the existence of reincarnation)
  * What is ego/self? Do we have an ego/self?
    * Is there a boundary between you and me or the stone and me?
    * If so, am I still me, since both inside and outside of me keep changing? (> Ship of Theseus)
    * If not, do we have self-consciousness? Probably not. It is but an illusion. (We may think we have.)
    * Is consciousness only a deliberate reason to make a fact (however weird) seem reasonable to ourselves?
    * And if there is no consciousness, there is no such thing as unconsciousness.
  * What is free will? Do we have free will?
    * Is there any decision we can make regardless of all external factors? (We may think we can.)
    * Back to the very moment that a decision to be made, would the result ever change? (> Determinism)
    * Yet we can always think we have ego/self, self-consciousness, and free will, as in idealism.
  * If free will exists, can we program it to enable spontaneity and initiative in AI systems?
    * Otherwise, what is the difference between humans and programmed robots?
    * Are we another kind of robot designed by some superior beings?
  * Do humans have spontaneity or initiative instead of unconditional passive response engraved in genes?
    * Is the so-called "objective/truth" solely from our sensors, i.e., visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and tactile sensations?
    * We could only sense what our sensors tell us. Yet, we call it the truth.
    * Or we call a commonly sensed thing as objective/truth. But most of us may be lied to by the sensors.
    * Are we humans just slaves of our sensors? What will happen if all the sensors are shut down? (Can we output without input?)

* **The Society (Culture, Religion, and Countries)**:
  * What is culture? What is religion?
  * What is society? What is a country?
  * What is civilization? How long will our civilizations last?
  * Do many past civilizations exist? Are there civilizations under the earth surface?
  * Is there a way to escape the destiny that the sun will devour the earth? Where else can we go?
    * Do we need to make the human race last longer? Why? What will happen if humans die out?
    * There is no such thing as a nuclear war that will "destroy the whole earth." It can only wipe out some creatures on the earth and change the landscape a bit. We are powerful enough to destroy ourselves, but not the earth. After all, humans are negligible to the earth (not to mention the universe).

* **The Universe (Life, Reality, and Supernature)**:
  * Is anything truly random (unpredictable or non-deterministic)? (> Laplace's demon)
    * This question is highly related to "Do we have free will?"
    * If so, find a true example. If not, Determinism is established.
    * Could some rules in quantum mechanics or the black hole be examples of true randomness?
      * (Probably not, since we know almost nothing about them.)
  * What is "meaning"? Does anything have a meaning? (> Nihilism)
    * Is the meaning only a reason deliberately sought to make something make sense to someone?
    * (We can still be optimistic even though nothing fundamentally matters. Let's lie to ourselves!)
  * What is life or being alive?
    * What is the relationship between life and time?
    * Is time only an artifact for us to measure life?
    * Is there no life if there is no time or time limit? (Eternal life means no lived.)
  * What is death or being dead?
    * Does death exist? There may not be a thing as death if we do not have an ego/self.
    * Are we humans, together with the whole universe, a whole self? If so, no death.
    * Assume that death exists, what will happen after death? Is there reincarnation?
    * Are we humans a pure body (realism), a pure soul (idealism), or both?
  * Is our universe a programmed virtual world designed by some superior beings?
    * What is reality? We might only believe what we think is real to be reality.
    * Why do physical constants, such as the Planck constant and speed of light, have fixed values?
    * Is there a set of absolute truth and universal law that governs everything?
      * If so, Determinism is established. We might be glad to find some rules via our observations, just as modern science does. However, what is the difference between knowing or not knowing the rules, deducting/predicting the future or not, as the future is ultimately determined/destined?
      * If not, where does the uncertainty come from? (Just like the "true randomness" question.)
  * Is there any so-called "alien" in the universe?
    * If human exists, why not aliens? We might lack the ability to identify them.
    * Why is a rock, a tree, the sun, a black hole, or an atom not being deemed as a life? Why not?

* AND MORE...
