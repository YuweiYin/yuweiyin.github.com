## Academic & Research Background

[Academic Record](https://yuweiyin.github.io/courses/) (academic courses & GPA trajectory)

### Undergraduate (2014 - 2018)

I received my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Beijing Information Science & Technology University](https://english.bistu.edu.cn/) (BISTU), where I comprehensively studied various CS courses and developed a solid foundation in the CS field. In my sophomore year, I started my first research on the Undergraduate Innovation Project (national level). One year later, we developed a smart band system (Software & Hardware) to measure the heart rate and sports situation and published a journal paper. Then in my senior year, I interned at the Trusted Computing and Information Assurance Laboratory (TCA), [Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.is.cas.cn/) (ISCAS), where I finished my graduation project (excellent award) by developing a privacy-protected system (Android & Web applications) based on single sign-on (SSO) and OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect.

### Postgraduate (2018 - 2021)

After graduation, I was recommended to the M.S. program at the State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment, School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) (BUAA). In the first year, we developed a data mining and website system for a funded program. Apart from the lab project and advanced CS courses, I studied machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing by myself. Then I decided to dive into NLP research and changed my program to Ph.D. in 2019.

In my first doctoral year, I still had to take general CS instead of NLP-specific courses. Meanwhile, I worked as a teaching assistant in Discrete Mathematics and took on the operation and maintenance of a lab system. Back then, I was intrigued by neural machine translation (NMT) research. Unfortunately, the computing resource in the lab was relatively scarce. Thus my experiments could hardly run in the basic deep learning settings, let alone conduct smoothly and try various novel ideas. To add insult to injury, [Coronavirus disease 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19) (COVID-19) forced everyone to stay at home until Fall 2020.
<!-- Unfortunately, my experiments were hard to conduct smoothly, mainly because the computing resource was rather scarce in the lab. -->

After returning to Beijing, I decided to take an internship in the research group of a technology company with adequate computing resources. Then, I joined the [Natural Language Computing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-computing/) (NLC) group of [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (MSRA) as a full-time research intern. Since then, I immersed myself in a positive academic atmosphere and focused on NMT research, solving the low- and zero-resource multilingual translation problems. It was extremely enjoyable to design cutting-edge NLP algorithms and to have inspiring and scintillating discussions with so many excellent researchers.

### Watershed (September 2021)

<!-- However, to my mind, relying on the internship to finish the Ph.D. program is not a long-term solution. Let alone the policy that interns have to check out after 1.5 years at most in Microsoft. To pursue careers in academia, I was determined to reboot my postgraduate journey and get a doctorate degree elsewhere. To pursue careers in academia, I was determined to reboot my postgraduate journey and get a doctorate degree elsewhere. In fact, I planned to apply to programs in the US. Since Beihang University is the top target of the [Presidential Proclamation 10043](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_10043) (PP 10043), I chose to forgo the Master's and Ph.D. degree there in order to have a better chance of getting the VISA and admission. Therefore, I left Beijing in September 2021, gave myself one year gap, and applied to oversea postgraduate programs at the end of 2022. -->

However, to my mind, having to rely on the internship to finish the Ph.D. program was unfavorable and precarious. Plus, there were countless unreasonable regulations and lamentable misfortunes owing to the pandemic. To pursue careers in academia, I was determined to reboot my postgraduate journey and get a doctorate degree elsewhere, such as in America. Since Beihang University is the top target of the [Presidential Proclamation 10043](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_10043) (PP 10043), I chose to forgo the M.S. and Ph.D. degree there in order to have a better chance of getting the VISA and admission. Therefore, I left Beijing in September 2021, gave myself one year gap, and applied to oversea postgraduate programs at the end of 2022.

<!-- Consequently, changing  it was extremely hard distracting. -->
