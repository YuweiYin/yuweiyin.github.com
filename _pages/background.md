## Academic & Research Background

[Academic Record](https://yuweiyin.github.io/gpa/) (GPA Trajectory & Academic Courses & Transcript Scores)

### Undergraduate (2014 - 2018)

I received my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Beijing Information Science & Technology University](https://english.bistu.edu.cn/) (BISTU), where I comprehensively studied various computer science (CS) courses and developed a solid foundation in the CS field. In my sophomore year, I participated in the Undergraduate Innovation Project (national level) as an undergraduate research assistant. One year later, we developed a smart band system (software & hardware) to measure heart rate and sports situation. Then in my senior year, I interned at the Trusted Computing and Information Assurance Laboratory (TCA), [Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.is.cas.cn/) (ISCAS), where I finished my graduation project by developing a privacy-protected system (Android APP & website) and won an excellent award.

### Postgraduate (2018 - 2021)

After graduation, I was recommended to the M.S. program at the State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment, School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) (BUAA). In the first year, we developed a data mining and web system for a funded program. Apart from the research assistant projects and graduate CS courses, I studied machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP) by myself. Then I decided to dive into NLP research and changed my program to Ph.D. in 2019.

In my first doctoral year, I worked as a teaching assistant in Discrete Mathematics and took on some lab projects. Back then, I was intrigued by neural machine translation (NMT). Unfortunately, the computing resource in the lab was limited. Hence, I could hardly experiment on a basic NMT model setting, let alone conduct smoothly and try new ideas. Worse still, [Coronavirus disease 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19) (COVID-19) forced everyone to stay at home until Fall 2020.

<!-- I decided to take an internship in the research group of a technology company with adequate computing resources. Then -->
After returning to Beijing, I joined the [Natural Language Computing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-computing/) (NLC) group of [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (MSRA) as a full-time research intern. Since then, I immersed myself in a positive academic atmosphere and focused on NMT research, solving challenging multilingual translation problems. It was extremely enjoyable to design cutting-edge NLP algorithms and to have inspiring and scintillating discussions with so many excellent researchers.

### Watershed (September 2021)

However, having to rely on the internship to finish the doctoral program is unsystematic, unstable, and unsatisfactory. Furthermore, there were countless unreasonable regulations and lamentable tragedies owing to the pandemic and other deeply ingrained problems. To pursue careers in academia, I was determined to reboot my postgraduate journey and get a doctorate degree elsewhere. Therefore, I left Beijing in September 2021, gave myself one year gap, and applied to oversea postgraduate programs at the end of 2022.

Since Beihang University was the top target of the [Presidential Proclamation 10043](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_10043) (PP 10043), I chose to forgo the postgraduate degree there in order to have a better chance of getting the VISA and admission. -->

## Gap Year (2022)

## Before College (2011 - 2014)

I spent a memorable three years and finished my high school study at Chengdu Shude High School ([SDZX](http://www.sdzx.net/)), Sichuan province, China. I miss the old days when we studied together and won the championship of the school soccer tournament. In the 2014 summer, I ranked top 1% of 570,000+ examinees in Sichuan [GaoKao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaokao) (National College Entrance Examination), which marked the end of my teenage years.
