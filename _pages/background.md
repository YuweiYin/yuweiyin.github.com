### Undergraduate (2014 - 2018)

I received my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Beijing Information Science and Technology University](https://english.bistu.edu.cn/) (BISTU), where I comprehensively studied various computer science (CS) courses and developed a solid foundation in this field. In my sophomore year, I participated in a national-level Undergraduate Innovation Project as an undergraduate research assistant. One year later, we developed a smart band system (software & hardware) to measure heart rate and sports situation. Then in my senior year, I interned at the Trusted Computing and Information Assurance Laboratory (TCA), [Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.is.cas.cn/) (ISCAS), where I finished my graduation project by developing a privacy-protected system (Android & Web).

### Postgraduate (2018 - 2021)

After graduation, I was recommended to the M.S. program at the State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment, School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) (BUAA). In the first year, we developed a data mining and web system for a funded program. Apart from the research assistant projects and graduate CS courses, I dived into machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP). Then I decided to change my program to Ph.D. in 2019.

In my first doctoral year, I worked as a teaching assistant in *Discrete Mathematics* and took on some lab projects. Back then, I was interested in neural machine translation (NMT). I chose to research multilingual NMT because I regarded it as a way to break the language barrier so as to promote peace in the world. Unfortunately, the research environment in the lab was unexpectedly undesirable, and the computing resource was extremely limited. Hence, I could hardly run basic NMT models, let alone try new ideas. Worse still, [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19) forced everyone to stay at home until Fall 2020.

<!-- I decided to take an internship in the research group of a technology company with adequate computing resources. Then -->
After returning to Beijing, I joined the [Natural Language Computing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-computing/) (NLC) Group at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (MSRA) as a full-time research intern. Since then, I immersed myself in a positive academic atmosphere and focused on NLP research, solving challenging multilingual NMT problems. It was extremely enjoyable to design cutting-edge NLP algorithms and to have inspiring and scintillating discussions with so many excellent researchers.

### Watershed (September 2021)

However, having to rely on the internship to finish the doctoral program is unsystematic, unstable, and unsatisfactory. Furthermore, there were countless unreasonable regulations and lamentable tragedies owing to the pandemic and other deeply ingrained problems. To be well-trained in this field and pursue a career in academia, I was determined to reboot my postgraduate journey. Therefore, I left Beijing in September 2021, gave myself one year gap, and applied to the postgraduate program at the end of 2022.

<!-- One who lived there could vividly tell how miserable the environment was. -->
<!-- To pursue careers in academia, I was determined to reboot my postgraduate journey and get a doctorate degree elsewhere, such as in America. Since Beihang University was the top target of the [Presidential Proclamation 10043](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_10043) (PP 10043), I chose to forgo the postgraduate degree there in order to have a better chance of getting the VISA and admission. -->

## Before College (2011 - 2014)

I spent a memorable three years and finished my high school study at Chengdu Shude High School ([SDZX](http://www.sdzx.net/)), Sichuan province, China. I miss the old days when we studied together and won the championship of the school soccer tournament. In the 2014 summer, I ranked top 1% of 570,000+ examinees in Sichuan [GaoKao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaokao) (National College Entrance Examination), which marked the end of my teenage years.
